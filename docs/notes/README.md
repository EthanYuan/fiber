# Developing Notes

The notes presented in this directory are intended to group multiple related docs into a
more readable and more maintainable way. Below is a few use cases for these notes.

- Explaining some concepts across multiple source code locations.
- Giving an overview of some historical background on implementation.


This is inspired by the notes in GHC source code. See [The Notes of GHC](https://www.stackbuilders.com/blog/the-notes-of-ghc/).
